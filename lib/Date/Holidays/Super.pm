=head1 NAME

Date::Holidays::Super - a SUPER class for the Date::Holidays::* modules

=head1 SYNOPSIS

	package MyHolidays;

	use Date::Holidays::Super;
	use vars qw(@ISA);

	@ISA = qw(Date::Holidays::Super);

	my $mh = MyHolidays->new();

	my $bool = $mh->is_holiday( ... ); 

	my $hashref = $mh->holidays( ... ); 

=head1 VERSION

This POD described version 0.03 of Date::Holidays::Super

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This is a SUPER class intended for use by Date::Holidays::* modules.

The goal is to have all the existing and future modules implement the
same methods, so they will have a uniform usage and can be used in
polymorphic context or can be easily adapted into the Date::Holidays
class.

The class provides two methods: B<is_holiday> and B<holidays> an
alternative to this class is Date::Holidays::Abstract, which does not
implement these methods, but require that they are implemented.

If you want to use Date::Holidays::Super and want to comply with my
suggestions to the methods that ought to be implemented, you should
overload the methods provided by this class, when and if you have the
time in your Date::Holidays::* module.

=head1 SUBROUTINES/METHODS

=head2 is_holiday

Should at least take 3 arguments:

=over

=item year, four digits

=item month, between 1-12

=item day, between 1-31

=back

The return value from is holiday is either a 1 or 0 indicating true of
false, indicating whether the specified date is a holiday in the given
country's national calendar.

B<is_holiday> in the SUPER class returns 0 indicating false, since
nothing intelligent can be said about holidays without specifying a
national calendar.

Additional arguments are at the courtesy of the author of the using
module/class.

=head2 holidays

Should at least take one argument:

=over

=item year, four digits

=back

Returns a reference to a hash, where the keys are date represented as
four digits. The two first representing month (01-12) and the last two
representing day (01-31).

The value for the key in question is the local name for the holiday
indicated by the day. The resultset will of course vary depending on
the given country's national holiday. 

B<holidays> in the SUPER class return a reference to an empty hash,
since nothing intelligent can be said about holidays without specifying
a national calendar.

Additional arguments are at the courtesy of the author of the using
module/class.

--

L<Date::Holidays> uses the requirements defined by this module and this
module can therefor be used with success in conjunction with this.

This is an alternative to the abstract class L<Date::Holidays::Abstract>. 

Suggestions for changes and extensions are more than welcome.
