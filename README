NAME
    Date::Holidays::Super - a SUPER class for the Date::Holidays::* modules

SYNOPSIS
    package MyHolidays;

    use Date::Holidays::Super; use vars qw(@ISA);

    @ISA = qw(Date::Holidays::Super);

    my $mh = MyHolidays->new();

    my $bool = $mh->is_holiday( ... );

    my $hashref = $mh->holidays( ... );

ABSTRACT
    This is a SUPER class intended for use by Date::Holidays::* modules.

    The goal is to have all the existing and future modules implement the
    same methods, so they will have a uniform usage and can be used in
    polymorphic context or can be easily adapted into the Date::Holidays
    class.

DESCRIPTION
    The class provides two methods: is_holiday and holidays an alternative
    to this class is Date::Holidays::Abstract, which does not implement
    these methods, but require that they are implemented.

    If you want to use Date::Holidays::Super and want to comply with my
    suggestions to the methods that ought to be implemented, you should
    overload the methods provided by this class, when and if you have the
    time in your Date::Holidays::* module.

    is_holiday
    holidays

METHODS
  is_holiday
    Should at least take 3 arguments:

    year, four digits
    month, between 1-12
    day, between 1-31

    The return value from is holiday is either a 1 or 0 indicating true of
    false, indicating whether the specified date is a holiday in the given
    country's national calendar.

    is_holiday in the SUPER class returns 0 indicating false, since nothing
    intelligent can be said about holidays without specifying a national
    calendar.

    Additional arguments are at the courtesy of the author of the using
    module/class.

  holidays
    Should at least take one argument:

    year, four digits

    Returns a reference to a hash, where the keys are date represented as
    four digits. The two first representing month (01-12) and the last two
    representing day (01-31).

    The value for the key in question is the local name for the holiday
    indicated by the day. The resultset will of course vary depending on the
    given country's national holiday.

    holidays in the SUPER class return a reference to an empty hash, since
    nothing intelligent can be said about holidays without specifying a
    national calendar.

    Additional arguments are at the courtesy of the author of the using
    module/class.

    --

    Date::Holidays uses the requirements defined by this module and this
    module can therefor be used with success in conjunction with this.

    This is an alternative to the abstract class Date::Holidays::Abstract.

    Suggestions for changes and extensions are more than welcome.
