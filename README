       Date::Holidays::Super - a SUPER class for the Date::Holidays::* modules

               use vars qw(@ISA);

VVEERRSSIIOONN
       This POD described version 0.04 of Date::Holidays::Super

DDEESSCCRRIIPPTTIIOONN
       This is a SUPER class intended for use by Date::Holidays::* modules.

       The goal is to have all the existing and future modules implement the
       same methods, so they will have a uniform usage and can be used in
       polymorphic context or can be easily adapted into the Date::Holidays
       class.

       The class provides two methods: iiss__hhoolliiddaayy and hhoolliiddaayyss an alternative
       to this class is Date::Holidays::Abstract, which does not implement
       these methods, but require that they are implemented.

       If you want to use Date::Holidays::Super and want to comply with my
       suggestions to the methods that ought to be implemented, you should
       overload the methods provided by this class, when and if you have the
       time in your Date::Holidays::* module.

       iiss__hhoolliiddaayy

       Should at least take 3 arguments:

       year, four digits
       month, between 1-12
       day, between 1-31

       The return value from is holiday is either a 1 or 0 indicating true of
       false, indicating whether the specified date is a holiday in the given
       country's national calendar.

       iiss__hhoolliiddaayy in the SUPER class returns 0 indicating false, since nothing
       intelligent can be said about holidays without specifying a national
       calendar.

       Additional arguments are at the courtesy of the author of the using
       module/class.

       hhoolliiddaayyss

       Should at least take one argument:

       year, four digits

       Returns a reference to a hash, where the keys are date represented as
       four digits. The two first representing month (01-12) and the last two
       representing day (01-31).

       The value for the key in question is the local name for the holiday
       indicated by the day. The resultset will of course vary depending on
       the given country's national holiday.

       hhoolliiddaayyss in the SUPER class return a reference to an empty hash, since
       nothing intelligent can be said about holidays without specifying a
       national calendar.

       Additional arguments are at the courtesy of the author of the using
       module/class.

       --

       Date::Holidays uses the requirements defined by this module and this
       module can therefor be used with success in conjunction with this.

       This is an alternative to the abstract class Date::Holidays::Abstract.

       Suggestions for changes and extensions are more than welcome.
